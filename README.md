# Game of Life

Game of Life written in Clojure, Noir and jQuery. See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life if you're not familiar with
it.

Game of Life is a reasonably simple yet kind of realistic program that in my
opinion is great for getting started with a new programming language. This time
it's Clojure.

I don't claim that the code here is elegant or idiomatic Clojure. I do believe
it is beautiful in a sense, and I'm hoping that that's something that comes
with Clojure itself.

## Usage

1. Get Leiningen: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen
2. Run

```bash
lein deps
lein run
```

3. Point your browser to http://localhost:8080 and you should see some Game of Life action going on.
